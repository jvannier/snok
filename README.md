# Snok

Which is just "snake" remade using only vanillia JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. And this time you're a cat, collecting sparkles to leave everywhere.

Goal: How many sparkles can you collect?! Can you beat the high score?

# Prerequisites for running it

npm

which can be installed by installing nodejs

# Running it (starts live-server)

- `npm install .`
- `npm start`

Then you can start or pause the game with the spacebar and change the direction of the snok using the arrow keys.
